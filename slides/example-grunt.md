##  Example: Grunt

Install [grunt-babel](https://github.com/babel/grunt-babel) in your project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev grunt-babel
```

Create a `.babelrc` file:

```json
{

}
```

Note:

You're probably already using Grunt for unit tests, concatenation, minification, maybe even compiling Coffeescript!
