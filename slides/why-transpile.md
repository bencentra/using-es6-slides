##  Why Transpile?

There will always be an ["ES Next"](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/esnext/) specification.

Browsers will always lag behind the spec.

__You need a transpiler to write tomorrow's JS today.__



Note:

There will always be an ["ES Next"](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/esnext/) made up of future specifications at various stages of readiness.

Browsers will always lag behind the spec while they implement the new features.

Using a transpiler ensures you will always have access to the newest features while ensuring backwards compatibility.
