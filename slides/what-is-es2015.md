##  ES2015 (aka ES6)

[ES2015](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/) is the newest version of the ECMAScript standard.

Browsers are [still implementing](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) ES2015 features.

Use a __transpiler__ such as [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to compile ES2015 to ES5.



Note:

[ES2015](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/) (aka ES6) is the newest version of the ECMAScript standard. JavaScript is based on this standard.

ES2015 features are not fully implemented in all major browsers yet, but they [will be eventually](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/).

For now you can use "transpilers" such as [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to turn ES2015 into browser-friendly ES5 as a build step in your project.

(You're already "building" your JavaScript if you use Grunt/Gulp for running tests, concat-ing and minify-ing files, etc)
