##  Grunt

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is a "JavaScript Task Runner"

Used for automating build tasks:
* Concatenation
* Minification
* Unit Testing
* Code Linting

Use [grunt-babel](https://github.com/babel/grunt-babel) for transpiling



Note:

[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is a "JavaScript Task Runner."

You're probably already using Grunt (or maybe Gulp) to create automated work flows for: unit tests, concatenation, minification, maybe even compiling Coffeescript!

You can use `grunt-babel` to add a transpilation task!
