##  Babel

[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is a "JavaScript compiler" that includes:

* **Syntax transformers:** `class`, `let` and `const`, `=>`
* **Polyfills:** Promises, Map and Set, Object.assign()

CLI + integration with common tools (Grunt, Karma, etc).



Note:

Babel "is a JavaScript compiler", probably the most popular transpiler out there (Google has Traceur).

Uses "syntax transformers" (ES6 -> ES5 conversion) and polyfills to enable ES2015+ features in your browser.

Can be integrated with build tools, module bundlers, test frameworks, IDEs, CLI, and more.

If you keep it updated, it will continue to add new features as the ECMAScript spec evolves.
